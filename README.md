- [SVG and HTML] -  REACT uses html template to render the original jsx
- [CSS] - Used to change styles of the website
- [Javascript] - Used to make the content dynamic
- [DHTML] - Using react, it uses JSX, hence DHTML is used
- [node.js] - used to fetch the data from the database
- [Client side framework] - React,js
- [Database ] - Dexie
